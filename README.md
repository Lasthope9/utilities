Explanation:
String Manipulation:

The program takes user input, manipulates it (reverse and length), and stores the results in a collection (List).
Collections:

The results of the string manipulation are stored in a List<String>. You can extend this to include sets or maps as needed for other types of data.
File Handling:

The program writes the manipulated string data and a timestamp into a file (results.txt). Errors are handled using a try-catch block.
Date and Time:

The program logs the date and time each entry was made, formats the date, and stores it along with the results.
